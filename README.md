For the February 2017 meeting of the Digital Approaches Reading Group (DARG) at WashU, we explored 58 Presidential Inaugural Addresses as a common dataset in the hopes of showcasing and experimenting with different DH methodologies and tools.

Since President Trump concluded his address with the trademark slogan "Make America Great Again," I wanted to explore how previous Presidents had used the word “great,” so I used the Python module TextBlob, specifically its part-of-speech tagger and ngrams function, to isolate all the nouns that came immediately before or after the word “great” in every speech.

Check out the interactive force-directed semantic network of this data [here](http://melaniewalsh.org/network/index.html) or [my blog post](http://melaniewalsh.org/presidents_great_things/) for other visualizations and more information.
